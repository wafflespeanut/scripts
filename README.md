Mathematica
===
These are just backups of my Mathematica notebooks. I often play with it. Almost all of these were made for my blog posts, and for demonstrating something to someone.

This includes plots from real experimental data, theoretical plots from equations, animations of mechanisms (both nice & screwed!), etc.
